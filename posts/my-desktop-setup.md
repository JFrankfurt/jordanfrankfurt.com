I've finally got a desktop workstation arrangement that I'm relatively happy with. I'm usually working with two computers throughout the day one runs Windows/Ubuntu for personal gaming and dev work. The second is a macbook pro for work.

## Common Components

- DSLR camera: Fuji X-T4
- Lens: Fujinon XF16-55mmF2.8 R LM WR
- Magewell HDMI-USB 1080p capture dongle (The Elgato 4k camlink was sold out due to Corona, else I would have purchased that.)
- Manfrotto PIXI Mini Tripod
- Dell 24" 1440p 144hz monitor
- Dell 27" 4k 60hz monitor
- Dual monitor arm desktop VESA mount
- Vari electric standing desk
- Coolermaster Master Keys M w/ white LEDs
- Razer Deathadder mouse
- Razer mousepad (Mine is no longer produced, but the Acari seems like the closest that's available.)
- Elgato Key Light
- Elgato Wave:3
- Tripp Lite 1500VA UPS
- Amazon Basics 12 outlet surge protector

## Personal Machine

- Lian Li mITX case
- Some ASRock motherboard ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- GTX 1080ti
- Intel Core i5
- Corsair Dominator Platinum 16gb DDR4 3000mhz
- Corsair VOID RGB Elite wireless gaming headset

## Work Machine

- `macbook pro`
- Cablematters 85W Thunderbolt 3 dock
- Bose QC35 II headphones

## Potential improvements

- I am still missing an external audio setup. It would be nice to not _have_ to use headphones for everything.
- I wish I didn't have to manually switch my mouse, keyboard, headphones, and mic when I switch machines. I want a simple button to switch which machine is receiving peripheral output.
- Now that I've got desktop mic I'm hoping to switch to a pair of wired dedicated headphones.
