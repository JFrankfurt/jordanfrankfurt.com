I find it amusing that I was writing drafts of another post titled "thinking about having kids" seven months ago. It's happening for sure now for sure. Lauren's four months pregnant.

People ask me how it feels frequently. I think the thing that crosses my mind most is confusion at the state of myself in relation to parenthood. Parenting seems an act of people who understand more about the world (and themselves) than I do. While I think I am maybe slightly better prepared to shepherd another human into the world than the average, I am having a hard time imagining what I will actually need to _do_. I am concerned that one day when the kid is 12 I will realize that I totally forgot something important I should/could have done for them and it'll be too late.

It's reassuring to see people like Bryan Caplan talking about how you really don't need to do that much for kids to turn out alright, but at the same time it's clear he puts a lot of effort into providing his homeschooled kids what he believes to be the ideal educational and general childhood experience. So, I guess to summarize, I'm stressed out because I care a lot and I'm not sure where I should be applying that care (if anywhere).
